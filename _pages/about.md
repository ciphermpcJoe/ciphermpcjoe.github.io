My name is Zhaohong (Joe) Wang, and I am an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in California State University, Chico.

Teaching and Research
======
My teaching spans embedded systems, cryptographic applications in computing systems, and computer networks.  My research interests lie at the intersection of information forensics and security within embedded systems and computer architecture.  I'm particularly drawn to exploring data science in computer networks through the lens of graph-based signal analysis.  Currently, I'm guiding projects focused on **secure CPU** and **distributed computing**.
