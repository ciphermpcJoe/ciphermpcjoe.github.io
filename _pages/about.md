I mainly teach courses in embedded systems, cryptographic applications in computing systems, and computer networks. The projects I am suprvising now are about CPU security and distributed computing.

Recruitment and **Financial Support**
======
I am actively seeking self-motivated students to join my team. Successful candidates will be recruited through Chico State Enterprises and will receive compensation for their work.

The funding Sponsor requires that candidates should be U.S. citizens. If you are an undergraduate or master's student with a strong interest in CPU architecture and its security, as well as a passion for computer systems and a willingness to take on challenges, I encourage you to email me your CV/resume and unofficial transcripts. I would love to schedule a discussion about your qualifications and eligibility.
