Financial Support and Recruitment
======
I am actively seeking self-motivated students to join my team. Successful candidates will be recruited through Chico State Enterprises and will **receive compensation** for their work.

If you are an undergraduate or master's student with a strong interest in CPU architecture and its security, as well as a passion for computer systems and a willingness to take on challenges, I encourage you to email me your CV/resume and unofficial transcripts. I would love to schedule a discussion about your qualifications and eligibility.

Active Projects
======
Imagine the incredible opportunity of working remotely while earning a competitive salary comparable to that in the Bay Area, all while enjoying life in an affordable location like Chico, California. I would like to invite you to explore this career path by introducing you to a special opportunity within our team. We are offering a unique scholarship for a **research fellowship** focused on security, both hardware and software. The skills you gain through this fellowship will enhance your application portfolio for future job prospects in the field.

Secure Computation in Distributed Systems
------
Participating in this project will equip you with essential skills in cryptography and computer networking, preparing you for the job market. The training you receive will be unparalleled and will provide you with the knowledge and experience that **employers** are actively seeking. This opportunity will not only enhance your job applications but also open doors to prestigious graduate schools.

Privacy-Preserving Joint Computation
------
Working on this project will provide you with exposure to advanced topics in distributed computing. The foundational elements of this project include Linux socket programming (as covered in EECE 446) and cryptographic protocols.

Teaching and Research
======
My teaching spans embedded systems, cryptographic applications in computing systems, and computer networks.  My research interests lie at the intersection of information forensics and security within embedded systems and computer architecture.  I'm particularly drawn to exploring data science in computer networks through the lens of graph-based signal analysis.  Currently, I'm guiding projects focused on **CPU security and distributed computing**.
